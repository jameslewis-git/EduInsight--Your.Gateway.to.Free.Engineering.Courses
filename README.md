## Development Notes

### Static Export with Dynamic Routes

The project uses Next.js static export (`output: 'export'`) while supporting dynamic routes with client-side data fetching. This required special configuration:

1. Route segment configs for dynamic pages:
   - `/src/app/auth/callback/config.js`
   - `/src/app/signup-confirmation/config.js`
   - `/src/app/courses/config.js`

2. Suspense boundaries around components using client hooks like `useSearchParams()`

3. Netlify redirects for dynamic routes in `netlify.toml`

### Authentication Flow

The authentication flow integrates with Supabase and includes:
- Login/Signup pages
- Email confirmation
- Auth callback handling
- Session management

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Future Roadmap

1. **Q2 2025**: Integration with real course APIs
2. **Q3 2025**: Personalized recommendation engine
3. **Q4 2025**: Social features and community
4. **Q1 2026**: Mobile app development
